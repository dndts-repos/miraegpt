## Using MiraeGPT
MiraeGPT is designed to work like ChatGPT but specifically for crafting replies for Backmarket's SAV.

Here is an example:

Suppose Backmarket asked
> Hi ecomobile, Could you please contact UPS to find out why the parcel wasn't delivered?

You should try and paraphrase the questions using keywords you saw by reading the [ecomms notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s1b0FkAROP_YMSLDiVSGTnAVqHMvGcpvR7EX9XFqEvg/edit?usp=sharing) and the context of the SAV situation. 

Suppose the context is 
> The parcel is marked delivered but the customer did not received the parcel. 

Then you should paraphrase the question as 
> The customer has yet to received their parcel despite parcel being marked as delivered.

Then, enter the paraphrased question into the input box.

Subsequently, you will get a response back from MiraeGPT. 

![MiraeGPT's Response](assets/miraegpt-response.png)

You can use/edit the response provided by MiraeGPT before sending it back to Backmarket. 

In the event where MiraeGPT did not provide you with a desired response, you can rephrase your questions again. For example, 
> Could you help me craft a response to Backmarket?

<div style="border: 2px solid #f5c6cb; padding: 5px; background-color: #f8d7da; color: #721c24;">
  <strong>Important:</strong>
  <p>While MiraeGPT is able to provide you a response, you still have to do your <b>due diligence </b> to ensure that the response provided by MiraeGPT is valid.</p>
</div>

### Cross Reference
Suppose you want to cross validate MiraeGPT's response, MiraeGPT will provide sources which it has referenced from. For example,

![Reference Source](assets/reference-source.png)

You can follow the sources and find the template used in the [ecomms notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s1b0FkAROP_YMSLDiVSGTnAVqHMvGcpvR7EX9XFqEvg/edit?usp=sharing)

### Dealing with Multiple SAVs
Currently, 1 MiraeGPT browser tab is efficient in dealing with 1 SAV. Suppose you are handling multiple SAVs, you should **open another tab** of MiraeGPT and ask your new questions there.

+ This is because every tab of MiraeGPT keeps track of its chat history. When answering your question, it will look at the chat history to get the context before providing a response. As such, asking it to handle multiple SAVs might cause it to perform poorly.

  <strong>Note:</strong> 
  <p>If you donâ€™t understand the explanation above, its fine, just remember</p>
