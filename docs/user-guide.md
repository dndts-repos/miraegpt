## How to use MiraeGPT

- Use MiraeGPT like how you would use ChatGPT
- You will use MiraeGPT as an assistant that crafts replies for you to reply Backmarket SAV.
- Whenever Backmarket prompt us for a response,
    - *Example:  Hi ecomobile, Could you please contact UPS to find out why the parcel wasn't delivered?*
- You should help to paraphrase the question using some keywords you got from  reading `ecomms notes (june 28 version)` and the context of the SAV situation.
    - *Example: Perhaps the parcel is marked delivered but the customer did not receive the parcel.*
    - *Paraphrased Question: The customer has yet to received their parcel despite parcel being marked as delivered.*
- Type the paraphrased question into the input box.

- MiraeGPT will provide you a response that you can copy, edit and paste as a response to Backmarket.
    - In the event that MiraeGPT did not provide you a response, you can re-prompt it by saying something like: *Could you help me craft a response to Backmarket?*

**Note that will MiraeGPT are able to provide you a response, you still have to do your due diligence in ensuring that the response provided by MiraeGPT is valid.**

- In the event that you need to cross validate MiraeGPT’s response, after every response, there will be `Reference sources` at the end which shows that template (from `ecomms notes (june 28 version)` ) MiraeGPT has used in order to generate the response.

## Side Note

As of now, using one tab of MiraeGPT is efficient in dealing with one SAV. Suppose there are multiple SAVs, you should open a new tab of MiraeGPT and ask your questions there. 

- This is because for every tab of MiraeGPT, it keeps track of the chat history between you and MiraeGPT. Hence, whenever MiraeGPT answers, it will look at the chat history to get the context of the situation before providing a response. As such, asking it to handle too many issues might cause it to perform poorly.

*If you don’t understand the explanation above, its fine, just remember*

***For every new issue, open a new tab of MiraeGPT***

*For those who care: We are in the process of changing the User Interface so that you do not have to open a new tab for every new issue.*
