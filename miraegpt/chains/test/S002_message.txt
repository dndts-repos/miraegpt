Hi there,

The recipient of this order claims they haven't received it, even though the tracking shows up as delivered.

We have asked the customer to look for their package in case it was delivered to a neighbour or family member. If they can't find the package, we asked them to provide the Certificate of Non-receipt and their ID.

Please send us a Proof of Delivery (POD) with the customer's signature, or a photo of the package being handed to the customer, within 48 hours.

Please note: a POD without a signature will not be considered relevant.

- If POD is provided, a police report will be required from the customer to process the claim.
- If no POD is provided within 2 business days: only ID + Certificate of Non-receipt will be required.

If the package is lost and the customer has provided all the necessary paperwork, they can choose between a refund or a reshipment. In this case, we recommend that you block the device, if possible.

In case the order is not found, and the customer decides a replacement, are you able to send one?

If not, we'll handle the refund.

Thanks for your help.

Looking forward to hearing from you,
<name>, Back Market Customer Care
