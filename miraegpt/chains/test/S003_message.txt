Hello!

The customer claims that the parcel was delivered empty. We have requested the BM certificate of non-receipt, pictures of the package, picture of the label with tracking number visible, pictures of the package inside (with the product received inside if any) and police report.

Once all the paperwork has been gathered weâ€™ll let you know if the customer prefers a refund or a reshipment. The deadline is 24 hours from reception of the documents

Best regards,
