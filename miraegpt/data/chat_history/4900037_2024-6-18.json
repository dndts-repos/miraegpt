I can hardly hear the audio files that are sent to me via WhatsApp, although the volume is set to maximum in the settings. I also had a problem when I tried to log in to Facebook. Every time I downloaded the app, I was redirected to a foreign account, which I suspect belongs to the previous owner of the phone. For all these reasons, I would like to exchange my phone for another iPhone 13 Pro, preferably in Sierra Blac. Is there a phone number where we can reach each other?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nMaria Carla Olivera\r\n\r\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help,",
