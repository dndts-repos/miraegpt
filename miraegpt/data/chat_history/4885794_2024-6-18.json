It is dirty, one large and many small grease stains, dust, streaks, etc. \n\nHis question is how he should proceed. He has not yet cleaned the appliance and therefore cannot say whether there are any scratches. He can't say anything about the technical function either. \n\nHow should the customer proceed? How should he clean the appliance?\n\nCan you offer the customer compensation so that he can keep the device?\n\nI would be pleased to receive an answer from you.\n\nHave a nice day.\n\nRegards,\nAngelica from the Back Care Team",

You could save the harmful carbon dioxide emissions generated by logistics carriers in facilitating a return of a device which is perfectly functional and fit to use for many years ahead.\n\nThank you.\nRegards, \nJH",
