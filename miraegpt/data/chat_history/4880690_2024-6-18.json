On one hand, there are visible scratches on the rear camera lens, and on the other hand, the speaker at the bottom right does not function or produces rustling/crunching sounds when playing music or videos. What can be done here? I would like to receive a new device and not send this one for repair. Since I've already transferred my old phone, I wanted to know if I can return this device when I receive a replacement device.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nFabio Sch\u00e4fer\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help,",
