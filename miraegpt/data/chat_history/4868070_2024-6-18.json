This is definitely not the case! I haven't had a UPS employee at the door, nor has a package been left with us. This is now the third time the package hasn't arrived! An absolute absurdity, apart from the effort involved in this annoying correspondence. And so much said beforehand, I will not fill out and sign a third inquiry request! Clarify the situation with UPS and please refund promptly, otherwise I'll dispute it at PayPal.\n\nThank you!\nJoachim Ax\nThank you for your help,",
