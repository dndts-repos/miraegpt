With this commercial gesture, you can use this amount to purchase a new cable. This helps reduce the harmful carbon dioxide emissions produced by logistics carriers when shipping an item.\n\nHowever, as for the phone case, unfortunately, this situation is beyond our control as we are only contractually obligated by BackMarket to provide the device and the charging cable, The case you\u2019ve mentioned is an extra gift provided directly by the accessories department of BackMarket when you decided to take up the accidental damage or insurance protection. \n \nRegards,\nJY",
