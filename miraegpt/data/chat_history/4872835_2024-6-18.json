After many attempts, I was able to transfer my data from my old iPhone. However, the screen becomes pink and pixelated (see photo) during use and restarts repeatedly. The received iPhone is not usable. I kindly request the sending of a new device with the same performance features like what was ordered, the color does not matter.\n\nThank you for your help,",
