This is the second product within a short time that does not meet the expected state. Very disappointing. I have already purchased several devices and was always satisfied. In the future, I will probably look for another provider when buying further devices.\nThank you very much for your help,\n\nThe customer confirms that the product has not been damaged due to drop or water, and has not been opened by a third party.",
