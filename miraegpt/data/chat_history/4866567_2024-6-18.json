Calling was only possible through the speaker, even when playing other tones, the upper speaker did not work. Additionally, navigating through Google Maps and Apple Maps was not really possible because the current location only updated every few minutes instead of constantly. I have tried all settings but nothing changed.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help,",
