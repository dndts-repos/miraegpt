My daughter was there and didn't see anyone, and there's no notification in the mailbox either.\nWe had explicitly posted a note on the door asking someone to knock. \n\nNow it's supposed to be delivered tomorrow, unfortunately, nobody will be home not even for the whole week.\n\nI tried to sign up with UPS to change the delivery, but unfortunately, I'm always asked for an InfoNotice number that I haven't received. This number should be noted on the notification, but I didn't receive this note.\nThe tracking number isn't enough here. \n\nThank you very much for your support.\nBest regards,\nChristine Suck\n\nThank you very much for your help,",
