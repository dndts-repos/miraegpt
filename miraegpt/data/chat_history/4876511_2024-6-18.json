The phone was described as being in excellent condition when I ordered it, but upon receipt, I noticed noticeable wear and tear (camera and front side top) despite this. I've decided to change my mind and prefer a completely new phone instead. Despite the good service and fast shipping, I'm returning it due to changed preferences.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help,",
