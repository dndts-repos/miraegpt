Is it perhaps possible to start another delivery attempt from May 27th? I've already tried using UPS, but it doesn't work. If you could send it via DHL, that would be great. That usually works much better for us.\nAlso, the package needs to be signed or a neighbor can accept and sign the package if necessary?\n\nBest regards,\nTim Bartelheimer \n\nThank you very much for your help,",
