As your product has already been shipped, in the event that you do not wish to keep the device, our logistics partner has suggested you to do the following.\n\n1. Refuse the parcel when a delivery attempt is made.\n2. If unable to refuse a parcel, do not open the product packaging. Use the return label provided by BackMarket and send the device back immediately.\n\nBy doing the following, you would be sure to receive a much FASTER REFUND for this order. \n\nThank you.\nRegards, \nTB",
