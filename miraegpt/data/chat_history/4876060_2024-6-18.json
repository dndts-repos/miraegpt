I didn't do anything unusual that could have caused the battery to drain faster. Normally, it lasts for 1-2 days. When I tried to charge it then, it only charged up to 4% before turning hot. I powered everything off and let it cool down overnight. The next day, when I turned it on again, the battery dropped another 10% within a few minutes, and it started getting hot again. I put it away and haven't used it since then.\r\n\r\nToday morning, I've reset everything back to factory settings and would like to return it now. I purchased this phone from you in October 2023.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help,",
