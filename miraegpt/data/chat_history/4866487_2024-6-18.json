I would like to proceed with changing this mobile phone for one that is equal but has a battery life consistent with the state in which I ordered it, since I have references from other people who received their mobile phones at 99% having bought them as Excellent.\n\nI hope this request can be made effective.\n\nThank you in advance! And also thank you for the service provided so far, it has been impeccable.\n\nWishing you a happy day,\nN\u00faria \n\nGratitude,",
