Can you kindly ask the customer to check the IMEI of the phone he currently has at home that was not being sent to us so that we can check and eliminate it from the two IMEIs that we have. This is done so that we can proceed smoothly with the repair/replacement for the phone. Thank you for your understanding and patience.\n\nRegards,\nCH",
