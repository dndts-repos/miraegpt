If it is a replacement, sends the new IMEI as well within 1 business day. Remember that if you do not send a valid tracking link in a message to us, it is as if you did not send it since we can not verify, and according to the QC, we have to refund.\n\nWe have listed some issues with their corresponding resolutions here in case these are preventing you from carrying out the refund. Please use the \"Report a Problem\" button on the bottom of the screen to declare an issue with the customer's return and stop a refund from being made on your behalf.\n\n1.
