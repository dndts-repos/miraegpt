Additionally, the package was later delivered to a different relay point than the one I had indicated. And towards the end of the afternoon when I went to pick it up, the phone wasn't inside and the box had been opened. I'm disoriented because my phone is essential for tomorrow's day; therefore, I would like another phone delivery as soon as possible and request a commercial offer from you due to the complete lack of seriousness in your delivery. I am completely disappointed with your services.\n\nThank you for your help,",
