In this case, we recommend that you block the device, if possible.\n \nIn case the order is not found and the customer chooses a replacement, are you able to send one?\n \nIf not, we'll handle the refund within --- CHOOSE ONE --- FOR IPHONES 12/13/14: 5 business days // FOR OTHER MODELS: 3 business days ---.\n \nThanks for your help.\n \nLooking forward to hearing from you,\nKubra, Back Market Customer Care",
