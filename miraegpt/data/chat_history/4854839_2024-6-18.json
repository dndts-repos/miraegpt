            "message": "Hello,\n\nMy iPhone 12 has a problem:\nThe product was going well at first, but after a few weeks the battery started to last less and significantly decreased, but I passed it off as just needing to be reset and then put back together. However, now the issue is more severe - when I woke up in the morning, the screen would turn green and I couldn't do anything. I looked online and people said to restart the phone, so I did, but it was still the same. I also saw that this often happens with iPhones, so since my phone is still under warranty, I'm requesting its repair or refund if not. Honestly, I'm not very happy with the phone due to all that's been happening.\n\nI hope for a response and that this won't be forgotten, thank you.\n\nThank you,",
