Unfortunately, I was very disappointed when I unpacked it.\nThe screen on the right shows a long scratch.\nThe edges are also not as good as they should be. The speaker is dirty. The silent button is also dirty. The edges of the display to the hardcase are worn out. This does not match the very good condition for this price!\n\nThank you for your help,",
