As I am dependent on this phone, a repair or cancellation is not an option. However, I expect to find this in excellent condition as well. \nI request a prompt inspection and discount, since the phone does not meet the offered conditions and thus the purchase price.\n\nThank you very much and best regards\nJessica Rathay\n\nThank you for your help,",
