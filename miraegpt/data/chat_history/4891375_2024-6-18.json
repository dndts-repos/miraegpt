This is way beyond what could be considered a \"good\" condition. The customer had the device for almost a year when they complained of screen issues. The multiple dents on the corners of the phone indicate that the device has sustained multiple fall damage. \n\nAs such, we must declare this phone out of warranty. \n\nPlease relook into this case as the condition of the phone is very bad.\n\nRegards,\nRK",
