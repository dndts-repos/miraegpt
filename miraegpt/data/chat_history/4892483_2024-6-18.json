Upon removing the protective film, I confirm that it's the screen. The attached photos prove that the product does not conform to the order placed. I chose the state 'perfect condition' to receive a new screen. However, what I received is not what I expected.\nI am requesting a refund for the product and cancellation of my old phone return.\nThank you in advance for any necessary actions taken.\nSincerely,\nMrs. Manon Collibeaux\n\nThank you for your help,",
