However, it is important to note that the device was returned with visible scratches, which have downgraded its condition from EXCELLENT to FAIR. Our policy, as outlined in the Quality Charter, necessitates a deduction in such cases to reflect the current condition of the device.\n\nThe \u20ac60 deduction is a fair assessment considering the device's depreciation due to the scratches. This results in a partial refund of \u20ac208.31.\n\nWe hope the customer understands that this deduction is necessary to maintain the integrity and fairness of our quality standards.\n\nPlease let us know if there are any further questions or concerns.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\nBest regards,\nKW",
