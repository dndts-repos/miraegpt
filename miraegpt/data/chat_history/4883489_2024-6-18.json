During calls and audio playback, it initially sounds like there's interference and then it fixes itself and sounds good. This happens randomly, not always, but it makes me suspicious that the speaker is damaged. The battery level is 90% when not in use, but it always drains by 10-12% overnight, and even faster when used. And most importantly, it has a problem - I'm not sure if it's related to the screen or software - because the screen moves on its own when I write, specifically in user and password fields of any app I download (e.g., social media apps).\n\nThank you,",

I hope this message finds you amazing. \n\nThe customer also reported this: \"I would also like to comment that in the first 15 days the battery health dropped from 90 to 89 and considering that the phone was only charged once a day at most\". Please, let me know about the repair.\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nRegards,\nNatally from the Back Care Team",
