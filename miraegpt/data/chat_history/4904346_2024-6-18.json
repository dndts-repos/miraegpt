This is because a PIN code will be sent to the customer whenever they are not available during the delivery.\n\nThe customer's satisfaction is our priority, and this small step helps us guarantee a seamless delivery experience. Just a moment of your time could prevent any delivery issues.\n\nThank you for your understanding and cooperation.\n\nRegards,\nJY",
