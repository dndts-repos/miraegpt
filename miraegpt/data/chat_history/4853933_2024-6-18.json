The casing is full of deep scratches, with the paint severely damaged.\r\n\r\nI would like to exchange for a device in very good condition. If there isn't a green one available, I'd also accept a black one. If this isn't possible, please refund.\r\n\r\nPlease respond if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nDennis Kraft\r\n\r\nThank you for your help,",
