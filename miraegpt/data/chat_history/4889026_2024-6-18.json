            "message": "Hello,\n\nMy Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G is experiencing the following issue:\n\nSince I purchased my Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G from Back Market in January, I've noticed that mobile data connectivity (5G, 4G, etc.) has been very poor and unstable. This was not a problem on my old Samsung smartphone (Note10+, older model). I didn't realize this would be an issue because I use mobile hotspot on my computer. \n\nRecently, when trying to use the Samsung Pay app, I realized that it doesn't work on my new phone (it worked on my old one) and it opens in Korean. I learned that many refurbished smartphones can come from markets intended for other regions like America or Asia, which renders certain features and apps unusable. This also makes French operators' networks very unresponsive.\n\nI checked the software information of my Galaxy Note20 Ultra, purchased from you, and it comes from the South Korean market (KOO/KOO/KOO/SKC), designated for SK Telecom. \n\nAs I live in France, nothing is specified on your site, preventing me from using my product correctly. I would like to use the Commercial Warranty to exchange my smartphone for one produced for the French market, as that's what I paid 565.99\u20ac for and not a South Korean phone that doesn't work well in France.\n\nThank you for your understanding, hoping this can be resolved,\nBest regards.",
