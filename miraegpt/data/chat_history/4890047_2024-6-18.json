In the tracking, it showed it was in Ribarroja and in conversation, once it arrives at the destination, a refund will be made, but it hadn't left yet. I picked up the package and I'll reprint the sheet. Checked the content, sent photos again. It's not exactly clear what the problem is, but I would appreciate an explanation. From my side, I'll do the same thing again. Thanks.\nThanks,",
