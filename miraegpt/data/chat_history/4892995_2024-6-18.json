Then, an error message appeared: The account could not be created. I searched online and read that you can only create up to three new Apple IDs on an iPhone (possibly per year) and then that's it. It seems like this limit has already been reached before I got the iPhone. What can I do now? Thank you very much!\r\n\r\nThank you for your help,\r\n\r\nThe customer confirms that the product has not suffered any damage from a fall or water and was not opened by a third party.\r\n\r\nForeign Text: German",
