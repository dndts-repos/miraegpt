Refuse the parcel when a delivery attempt is made.\n2. If you are unable to refuse a parcel, do not open the product packaging. Use the return label provided by BackMarket and send the device back immediately.\n\nBy doing the following, you would be sure to receive a much FASTER REFUND for this order. \n\nHowever, if we may interrupt, if this change of mind is due to a cheaper alternative found, we are able to offer you a commercial gesture of 20 euros instead. \n\nThank you.\nRegards, \nJH",
