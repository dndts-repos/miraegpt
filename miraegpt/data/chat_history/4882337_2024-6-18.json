First, I had a SIM card that didn't work (also not with my old iPhone) and then I ordered a new one that worked for 1.5 days. Initially, the mobile data was gone. After turning off and on again, there was still no network. The phone wants the SIM PIN, it's also connected to networks, but remains without network. And this is despite two different cards from two different providers. Now, the card is in my old iPhone and I have full reception.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help,",
