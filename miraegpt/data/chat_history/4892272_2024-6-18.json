            "message": "Hello,\nMy iPhone 13 Pro has the above problem:\n\nDear Sirs and Madams, unfortunately, there are issues with the smartphone. The display shows stripes during usage of the phone. These appear differently. When I activate the screen lock, it briefly shows stripes. During normal use, the display also shows stripes intermittently. Furthermore, the maximum battery capacity is 100%. However, this cannot be the case. The battery drains quickly after a few hours, even though I'm not using the phone much. I have compared it to my first purchase (same model and lower battery capacity), and the battery lasts longer there.\n\nI would appreciate a prompt response. I was very satisfied with my first order from you. However, this second order is very disappointing. I hope we can find a solution for this, as that's a lot of money I paid here. Additionally, I would like to remain a customer at your store.\n\nBest regards,\nArnold Weber",
