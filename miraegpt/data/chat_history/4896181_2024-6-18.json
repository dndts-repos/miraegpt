When evaluated as very good, the casing should only have minor micro-scratches.\nThe scratches visible on the images do not, in my opinion, match this description and are also easily recognizable from 1m distance.\nI would be happy if we could find a solution here.\n\nThank you,\nand\nBest regards,\nAlexander Resch\n\nThank you for your help,",
