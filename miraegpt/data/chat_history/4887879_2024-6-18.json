The screen remains completely black, no reaction. I've tried charging the battery - with cable and also wirelessly. How do I get help or exchange the device now? I haven't received an invoice yet and wouldn't know how a return works. Help! It was a birthday gift for my son and he's disappointed!\n\nThank you for your help,",

Simply drop off your package at a nearby drop-off location. You can find a list of locations here: https://www.mydpd.at/shopfinder.\n\nBefore you prepare your return:\n1. Follow these instructions on how to return an item <https://help.backmarket.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014698640-Returns-and-refunds-instructions>\n2. Don't forget to include any accessories that came with your product\n3. Remove any existing protective film or wrapping\n4. Package your product and its accessories according to the tips below.\n\nHow to package:\n\u2022 The box should be sturdy and stable, with your product lying flat so it doesn't move during transit.\n\u2022 Stick the return shipping label on top of the box (you can also attach a spare label inside for identification in case the original one is lost or damaged).\n\u2022 Take photos of the package from inside and out before sending. This will protect you in case your product is damaged during transit.\n\nYour return is now ready to be dropped off! We'll notify you when it arrives at our location.\n\nBest regards,\nBack Market Customer Care, Back Market Customer Care",
