After about 11 months of normal use, the battery level has reached 79% (maximum capacity). I think the wear and tear are not normal for an 11-month-old device. The phone was only charged once a day and not excessively used. (Always loaded using optimized charging process). My phone is still within the 12-month warranty and I would like to inquire if my problem can be resolved under warranty? \n\nThank you for your help,",
