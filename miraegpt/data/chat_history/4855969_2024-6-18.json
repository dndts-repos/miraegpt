I hope you are having a great day, despite this matter!\n\nThe tracking status of this order has not changed in 4 business days and is now considered lost as per Back Market delivery policy. We have requested the Back Market certificate of non-receipt and picture of the customers ID to arrange a refund or a replacement.\n\nOnce all paperwork is collected we will open a claim with the BackShip team, you can follow the claim in SSC. We will let you know if the order needs to be reshipped or if it will be refunded. The deadline is 24 hours from reception of the documents\n\nIf at any point the delivery begins to move again a refund will not be issued and the order is considered to be late.\n\nBest regards,\nEdison - Back Market",
