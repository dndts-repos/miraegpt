Then came the message - it will arrive on May 24th - which is when I was at work. On Monday, May 27th, I received a notification that I can pick up my package at the pickup station. Yesterday (May 28th), I went there but there was no package. UPS says it was sent back to the sender again. Why? I would have picked it up - but had no chance. Where is the package now and who gave the order to return the package?",
