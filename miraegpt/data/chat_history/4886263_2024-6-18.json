Since the customer has had the phone for some time, it suggests that they were satisfied with the device upon receipt. After reviewing the pictures that the customer has sent us, it seems like the phone has a huge crack on the screen which is highly likely due to the phone being dropped, which may also explain why the phone has issues starting. Unfortunately, the warranty has been broken due to this and we are unable to help the customer with any repair or exchange of the device. Thank you.\n\nRegards,\nCH",
