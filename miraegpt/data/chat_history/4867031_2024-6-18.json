You can find a list of locations here: \n\nBefore you prepare your return, please follow these steps:\n1. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://help.backmarket.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014698640-Returns-and-refunds-instructions\">Find instructions on how to return an item</a>\n2. Don't forget to include any accessories that came with your product\n3. Remove any existing protective wrapping or film\n4. Wrap your product and its accessories according to the tips below.\n\nHow to wrap your product:\n\u2022 The box should be strong and sturdy, with your product nestled in a way that prevents it from moving during transport.\n\u2022 Stick the return label on top of the box (you can also attach an extra label inside for identification purposes if the original label is lost or damaged).\n\u2022 Take photos of the package from the inside and outside before sending it off. This protects you in case your product is damaged during transit.\n\nYour return is now ready to be dropped off! We'll notify you as soon as it arrives at our facility.\n\nBest regards,\nBack Market Customer Care, Back Market Customer Care",
