If they can't find the package, we asked them to provide the Certificate of Non-receipt and their ID, ---- ONLY IF THE ORDER IS AN IPHONE 12/13/14 (to remove) --- along with a proof of address.\n\nPlease send us a Proof of Delivery (POD) with the customer's signature, a photo of the package being handed to the customer, or a screenshot showing the GPS location of the delivery, within 2 business days. \n\nPlease note: any other POD will not be considered relevant (ie: unsigned document or unclear photo).\n\n- If a POD is provided, a police report will be required from the customer to process the claim. --- ONLY FOR ORDERS OF IPHONES 12/13/14 (to remove) --- Only reports requiring the customer to go to the police station will be accepted.---\n- If no POD is provided within 2 business days: only ID + Certificate of Non-receipt + --- ONLY FOR ORDERS OF IPHONES 12/13/14 (to remove) --- proof of address --- will be required.\n\nIf the package is lost and the customer has provided all the necessary paperwork they can choose between a refund or a reshipment. In this case, we recommend that you block the device, if possible.\n\nIn case the order is not found and the customer chooses a replacement, are you able to send one?\n\nIf not, we'll handle the refund within --- CHOOSE ONE --- FOR IPHONES 12/13/14: 5 business days // FOR OTHER MODELS: 3 business days ---.\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you,\nMirana, Back Market Customer Care",

Or is it the parcel seems to be delivered but he did not receive anything, which is the message that you sent us? Once this is clarified, we can proceed to take the necessary actions.
