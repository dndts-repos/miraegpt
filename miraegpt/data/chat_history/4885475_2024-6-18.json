            "message": "Hello,\r\n\r\nMy iPhone 13 has the above problem:\r\n\r\nThe device was purchased for our child. Shortly after the purchase, we decided that this phone is not needed. It was clear that it would be returned. It arrived. I opened the package to check if the phone is inside. Upon closer inspection, a scratch on the front side immediately caught my eye. Upon further examination, it can be seen that the display is also slightly affected externally. If I buy a phone with the rating '-very good-', I assume that the display will be in a brand new condition. Regardless of whether it would have been returned anyway.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help,",
