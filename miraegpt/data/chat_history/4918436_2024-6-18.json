Now I couldn't enter this anywhere in my new order. Is my VAT ID number stored with my data? Not that it's missing again now. My VAT ID is DE265 713 692. With friendly greetings\n\nThank you very much for your help,",

The retailer is from the Netherlands, I bought with a VAT ID, so the information about this should be on the invoice. The order had no ID number and cost 429.95\u20ac, i.e. with statutory sales tax. So now it would have to be a different invoice value. Please clarify. Thank you.\n\nThank you for understanding,\nFabio from Back Market",
