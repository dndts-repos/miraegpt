Additionally, it has scratches on the camera, sides, and bottom, like spider webs. Therefore, it's not in excellent condition. Moreover, I charged it with the original charging cable and after 2 minutes, the back started overheating a lot. So, I want a refund since it's not what I bought. I haven't even had time to set it up, so I haven't seen if everything is working properly or not. This is the second time I've had an issue with a Back Market device, and I'm very dissatisfied.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nWhen the seller receives the package, they have 3 business days (5 business days for laptops and appliances) to repair or replace the product, or 2 business days to make a refund if necessary.\r\nThe customer must meet the following requirements to process the return:\r\n\u2714 Confirms that the device has not been opened by a third party, exposed to water, or suffered an impact or fall\r\n\u2714 Confirms that they have deleted their personal data\r\n\u2714 Has confirmed that they have the return label.\r\n\u2714 Understands that accessories and purchase receipts must be included in the return package.\r\n\u2714 Understands that they have 14 days to use the return label.",
