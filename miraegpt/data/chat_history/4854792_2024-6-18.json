The built-in camera is optically very different from an original camera and does not take photos of the same quality as the manufacturer's. Additionally, the smartphone got very warm after being turned on for just a few minutes. It seems that a cheap counterfeit battery was installed, which makes the phone incompatible. Overall, it doesn't seem reliable, so we unfortunately have to send the phone back. Best regards Anna Hiltmann.\n\nThank you for your help,",
