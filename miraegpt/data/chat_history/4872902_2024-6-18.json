The package was shipped on the 14/05, but since then, there has been no news about the package. The logistics company does not know where the package is located. We need to return our old phone before June 2nd. As long as I don't receive my order, I won't be able to proceed with the return. Thank you for telling me how this will go? When can I expect my new purchase? Do you have a way to contact the logistics company? \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nThank you for your help,",
