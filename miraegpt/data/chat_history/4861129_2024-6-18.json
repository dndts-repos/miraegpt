I suspect that the delivery guy might have faked the delivery and stolen the object without delivering it to me. I'm really disappointed since it was my birthday gift. If you please help me, 600 euros isn't nothing.\n\nThank you for your help,",

If they can't find the package, we asked them to provide the Certificate of Non-receipt and their ID.\n\nPlease send us a Proof of Delivery (POD) with the customer's signature, a photo of the package being handed to the customer, or a screenshot showing the GPS location of the delivery, within 2 business days. \n\nPlease note: any other POD will not be considered relevant (ie: unsigned document or unclear photo).\n\nIf a POD is provided, a police report will be required from the customer to process the claim. \n\nThanks for your help.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you,\nAlice, Back Market Customer Care",
