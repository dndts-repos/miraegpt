Rather than sending a return, would you consider a 30 euros commercial gesture instead? You could save the harmful carbon dioxide emissions generated by logistics carriers in facilitating a return of a device which is perfectly functional and fit to use for many years ahead.  Do let me know if the customer accepts this gesture. Thank you.\n\nRegards,\nCH",
