However, as shown in the photos, there are several noticeable scratches and signs of use, including on the camera and Lightning port. Additionally, there was still a protective film stuck to the device, apparently from the previous owner. In summary, this quality is absolutely unacceptable and frustrating for me.\n\nThank you for your help,",
