But the customer, since the device originally uses a farts charging cable, wants 20-30 \u20ac to purchase one locally. We told her we can only offer 10,00 \u20ac or a redelivery of a compatible charging cable as per QC. Waiting for the respective selection. \n\nThe customer now also reported an Aesthetic degree discrepancy. So we offered him the respective solution and are waiting for him to select. We will keep you posted regarding further developments. Thank you for understanding. \n\nBest Regards,\n\nPaulo from the Back Care Team",
