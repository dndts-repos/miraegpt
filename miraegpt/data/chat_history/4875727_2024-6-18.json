The category doesn't match, meaning the agreed-upon condition wasn't delivered.\r\nThe screen also has a noticeable scratch and several small scratches. Unfortunately, I always get a reflection on this picture. The category doesn't match again!! The category doesn't match therefore.\r\n\r\nI would be agreeable to a price reduction of 60 Euros.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help,",
