This problem has been there since I first started using the phone. A restart or anything else doesn't change the problem.\r\nThank you for your help,",

According to the Quality Charter, Good condition requires the device to be free of scratches on the screen. The customer has had the device for a certain amount of time. This suggests that he was satisfied with the device condition upon receipt.\n\nNow that the device has scratches upon return, the grade is degraded to a FAIR condition.\n\nHence, a 40 euros deduction is reasonable which indicates that the customer receives a partial refund. Please check with the customer and get back to me. \n\nThank you,\nRegards,\nKJ",
