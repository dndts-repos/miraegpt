Unfortunately, my delivered device only has a maximum charging capacity of 84%. That's not what I expected from a device labeled as 'like new'. I've already purchased several refurbished iPhones and always received devices with 100% charging capacity under this rating. I generally support this sustainable variant.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't see the status of the device until it was set up, otherwise I would have sent the device back immediately. I also ordered screen protectors and cases parallel to my phone order.\n\nPlease let me know how we can find a satisfying solution together. \nBest regards,\nFrank N\u00fcrnberger\n\nThank you for your help,",

Rather than sending a return, would you consider a 30 euros commercial gesture instead?
