We have requested pictures of the outside of the package (with damages visible), a picture of the package label with the tracking number visible, a picture of the package showing the item inside, pictures of the packaging of the item received, and pictures of the damaged item (with damages visible) report.\n\nOnce we have all of the paperwork we\u2019ll let you know if the customer prefers a refund or a reshipment. The deadline is 1 business day after we've received the documents.\n\nAll the best,\nTiana-Rijamalala, Back Market Customer Care",

The device is visibly cracked according to the customer's picture, which indicates that the device has been dropped or has suffered damage. The device is hence out of warranty and we are unable to issue a repair/refund. Please assist the customer and kindly close the case if no further assistance is required.\n\nRegards,\nYR",
