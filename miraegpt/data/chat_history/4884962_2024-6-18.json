According to applicable law, these products cannot be sold in Europe, as confirmed by my lawyer (see attachment).\nI urgently request the sending of CE-certified device or refund of the paid amount. I will send you the non-European model and request an return shipping label here.\nI kindly ask to disregard any explanations about how the CE mark can be recognized in the system, as it is explicitly stated that the mark must be present on the device/packaging.\nThank you for your help,",
