No original backside of the phone (it doesn't even say 'iPhone' on it, but 'Product Red' - total no-go for a product with quality 'Excellent'). Remaining adhesive residue on the phone's back. Speakers and charging port are quite dirty. Thick scratches on the middle of the display (also total no-go for 'excellent' quality). Not a good display (Top-Notch above at the internal camera is not even completely filled with glass - optically very unattractive).\n\nThank you for your help,",
