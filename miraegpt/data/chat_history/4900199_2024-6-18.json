We have requested the Back Market certificate of non-receipt and picture of the customer's ID to arrange a refund or a replacement.\n\n\nOnce all the paperwork has been gathered, we\u2019ll let you know if the customer prefers a refund or a reshipment. The deadline is 24 hours from reception of the documents.\n\nIf at any point the delivery begins to move again, a refund will not be issued and the order is considered to be late.\n\nBest regards,\nTania - Back Market",

Kindly give us 5 more business days to work on the investigation as it is unfair that we were not notified of the situation. Do not refund the customer please. \n\nRegards,\nJH",
