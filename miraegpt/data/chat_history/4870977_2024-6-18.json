Would the customer accept a commercial gesture of 20 euros to avoid the hassle of returning the phone? With this commercial gesture the customer can use this amount to fund and offset the cost of repairing the screen at their neighborhood mobile repair shop. It also avoids the hassle of deleting all personal data when returning the phone and saves the harmful carbon dioxide emissions generated by logistics carriers when transporting the device back to our facility.\n\nRegards,\nCH",

The customer has had the device for a certain amount of time. This suggests that he was satisfied with the device condition upon receipt.\n\nNow that the device has dents upon return, the grade is degraded to a FAIR condition.\n\nHence, a 60 euros deduction is reasonable which indicates that the customer receives a partial refund of  euros.
