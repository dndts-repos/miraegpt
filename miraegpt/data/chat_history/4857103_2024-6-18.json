The crack is barely visible but very noticeable to the naked eye.\n\nThank you for your help,",

Rather than sending a return, would the customer consider a 40 euros commercial gesture instead? The customer can save the harmful carbon dioxide emissions generated by logistics carriers in facilitating a return of a device which is perfectly functional and fit to use for many years ahead. Kindly inform me whether the customer accepts this commercial gesture. Thank you.\n\nRegards,\nCH",
