            "message": "Hello,\nMy product iPhone 13 Pro has the above problem:\nI was supposed to receive the package on May 28th. Apparently, it couldn't be delivered because someone was home all day and waited for it. The delivery person didn't ring the doorbell. According to the tracking information, the package should have been delivered to the nearest UPS access point that same day. At the access point, allegedly, the package couldn't be handed over because the UPS office was closed that day. However, I called the access point the same day and it was open normally. It was said then that a re-delivery attempt would take place at the UPS access point the next day (May 29th). Four days have passed since then, but the package status has not changed. No delivery attempts were made by UPS.",

The deadline is 24 hours from reception of the documents\n\nIf at any point the delivery begins to move again, a refund will not be issued and the order is considered to be late.\n\nBest regards,\nOlga - Back Market",
