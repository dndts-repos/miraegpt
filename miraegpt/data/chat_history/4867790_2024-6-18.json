If they can't find the package, we asked them to provide the Certificate of Non-receipt and their ID.\n\nPlease send us a Proof of Delivery (POD) with the customer's signature, a photo of the package being handed to the customer, or a screenshot showing the GPS location of the delivery, within 2 business days. \n\nPlease note: any other POD will not be considered relevant (ie: unsigned document or unclear photo).\n\nIf a POD is provided, a police report will be required from the customer to process the claim. --- ONLY FOR ORDERS OF IPHONES 12/13/14 (to remove) --- Only reports requiring the customer to go to the police station will be accepted.---\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you,\nAlice, Back Market Customer Care",
