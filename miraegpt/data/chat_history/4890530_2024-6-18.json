Since I've only charged the phone once a day, the 500 charge cycles that have already occurred are not applicable.\r\n\r\nIf the battery life drops so rapidly, I won't be able to use my phone without a power bank or new battery in a year, and then the phone would still be less than two years old.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance and best regards,\r\n\r\nThanks for your help,",
