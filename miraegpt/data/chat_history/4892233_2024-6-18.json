According to the Quality Charter, EXCELLENT condition requires the device to be free of scratches on the shell. The customer has had the device for a certain amount of time. This suggests that he was satisfied with the device condition upon receipt.\n\nNow that the device has visible scratches upon return, the grade is degraded to a FAIR condition.\n\nHence, a \u20ac60 deduction will be made in the event our repair team is unable to fix the device.
