We have requested pictures of the outside of the package (with damages visible), a picture of the package label with the tracking number visible, a picture of the package showing the item inside, pictures of the packaging of the item received, and pictures of the damaged item (with damages visible) report.\n \nOnce we have all of the paperwork we\u2019ll let you know if the customer prefers a refund or a reshipment. The deadline is 1 business day after we've received the documents.\n\nAll the best,\nJhon, Back Market Customer Care",

Rather than sending a return, would you consider a 40 euros commercial gesture instead? You could save the harmful carbon dioxide emissions generated by logistics carriers in facilitating a return of a device which is perfectly functional and fit to use for many years ahead.\n\nRegards, \nJH",
