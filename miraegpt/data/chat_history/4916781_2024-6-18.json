The item only meets the condition description 'Good'. Despite having an applied screen protector, the scratch is still visible (see attached images). Although the item does not meet my order's 'Excellent' condition, I would be okay with a corresponding credit based on the 'Good' condition description, as I could accommodate this unwanted small imperfection. Please provide me with a response regarding this. Many thanks in advance and best regards, Matthias Bahlinger",

The smartphone was left unopened at home until his return from holiday on 7 June 2024!\n\nIs there any chance to give the customer a compensation?\n\nRegards,\nAna from the Back Care Team",
