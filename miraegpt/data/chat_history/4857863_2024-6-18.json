We have requested the Back Market certificate of non-receipt and picture of the customers ID to arrange a refund or a replacement.\n\nOnce all the paperwork has been gathered we\u2019ll let you know if the customer prefers a refund or a reshipment. The deadline is 24 hours from reception of the documents\n\nIf at any point the delivery begins to move again a refund will not be issued and the order is considered to be late.\n\nBest regards,\nRicardo-Filipe - Back Market",
