Since UPS didn't show up at 11:45 am, delivery will only happen on May 21st now. Except for the time delay, the same game will repeat itself. I don't intend to become a slave to the service provider.\r\nI generally refuse delivery through UPS. Please let me know immediately what the next procedure is. THE DEVICE HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID FOR!\r\nThank you very much for your help,",
