I ordered the phone from you in excellent condition and unfortunately, I'm not satisfied with the quality. As visible on the photos, the major issue is on the back. There are severe scratches on the camera housing, which immediately catch the eye. Additionally, there are small damages to the charging port. Furthermore, the speaker of the phone is dirty and has not been properly cleaned. For these reasons, I would like to exchange the device for another one that meets the standards",
