            "message": "Hello, \r\nMy iPhone 13 has the above problem: \r\nThere's a serious issue with delivery. The package should have been delivered last Thursday by UPS, was then shown as in transit and didn't appear. A day later someone from UPS stopped by to inquire about the whereabouts of the package but couldn't provide any further information. If I understand correctly, there was an issue on the UPS side with a subcontractor. Now I've checked the tracking today and it says that as the sender, you can file a claim for replacement. https://www.ups.com/track?loc=de_de&requester=QUIC&tracknum=1ZBF1560D901151036/trackdetails. It seems like the package has gone missing. I'd like to know what my next steps are. And if the iPhone isn't delivered within the next few days, I'd appreciate a refund. Thank you so much! \r\nThank you for your help,",
