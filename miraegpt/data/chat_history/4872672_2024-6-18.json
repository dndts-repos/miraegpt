I understand of course that it is a used phone - but so far I have not had such experiences with your devices. Is there anything I can do or you can recommend? \n\nRegards,\nFatma from the Back Care Team",

The customer can use the 20 euros to offset the cost if they ever decide to visit a neighbourhood repair shop to resolve the issue. It also avoids the hassle of deleting all personal data just for a battery repair when returning the phone and saves the world from harmful carbon dioxide emissions generated by logistics carriers when transporting the device back to our facility. \nA battery is easy to replace and most shops would be able to do it so you can protect the data within your device instead of a return.\n\nRegards,\nJH",

Maybe he also has a certified partner company in Hamburg or Kiel that could do the repair?\n\nRegards,\nFatma from the Back Care Team",
