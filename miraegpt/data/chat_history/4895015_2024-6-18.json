I'm heading to England on that day and I need my phone.\nWhen contacting them, they tell me that the address they had was incomplete, and after looking at it, I've seen that it's correct.\nMy question is whether if I don't receive it by Monday, I'll have to file a complaint with PayPal for not receiving the package.\nI'm waiting for help in finding a solution.\n\nThanks,",
