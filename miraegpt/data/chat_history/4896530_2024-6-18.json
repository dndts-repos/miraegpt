The screen is okay, but there are usage marks on all 4 corners (see photos). Apparently, the device has already fallen down or multiple times. I don't want to have it in this state and would like a full refund. Thank you for caring about this. This isn't my first time buying from Backmarket, and I'm looking forward to resolving this quickly.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help,",
