If they can't find the package, we asked them to provide the Certificate of Non-receipt and their ID, along with a proof of address.\n\nPlease send us a Proof of Delivery (POD) with the customer's signature, a photo of the package being handed to the customer, or a screenshot showing the GPS location of the delivery, within 2 business days. \n\nPlease note: any other POD will not be considered relevant (ie: unsigned document or unclear photo).\n\n- If a POD is provided, a police report will be required from the customer to process the claim. Only reports requiring the customer to go to the police station will be accepted.\n- If no POD is provided within 2 business days: only ID + Certificate of Non-receipt + proof of address, will be required.\n\nIf the package is lost and the customer has provided all the necessary paperwork, they can choose between a refund or a reshipment. In this case, we recommend that you block the device, if possible.\n\nIn case the order is not found, and the customer chooses a replacement, are you able to send one?\n\nIf not, we'll handle the refund within 5 business days\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you,\nAndrea, Back Market Customer Care",
