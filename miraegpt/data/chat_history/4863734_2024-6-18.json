Then, being half loose, they fell off and it turned out that one of the cameras has a dent on the exterior of the screen that doesn't affect its functioning but can be seen at first glance. I want you to offer some proposal whether it's a price reduction in good condition or normal condition because excellent condition is not what I paid for. I've attached the photos and hope to get a response soon, thanks.\n\nThanks,\n\nThe customer confirms that the device has not been opened or repaired by a third party, exposed to water or suffered damage due to impact or fall.",

Rather than sending a return, would you consider a 60 euro commercial gesture instead? You could significantly reduce the harmful carbon dioxide emissions generated by logistics carriers in facilitating a return of a device without hardware issues. This would definitely be a big help to the improvement of our environment. Thank you.\n\nRegards,\nJY",
