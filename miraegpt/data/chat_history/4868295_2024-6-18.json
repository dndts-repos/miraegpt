If they cannot find the parcel, I have asked them to provide the certificate of non-receipt and their ID.\n\nPlease send me a proof of delivery (POD) with the customer's signature, or a photo of the parcel given to the customer, within 48 hours.\n\nPlease note that a POD without a signature will not be taken into account.\n\n- If the POD is provided, a police report will be requested from the customer to process the claim.\n- If no POD is provided within 2 working days: only an identity document + a certificate of non-receipt will be required.\n\nIf the parcel is lost and the customer has provided all the necessary documents, they can choose between a refund or reshipment.\nIf the order cannot be found and the customer chooses a replacement, are you able to send one?\nIf not, we will arrange a refund.\n\nOnce the loss has been confirmed, we recommend that you block the device, if possible - I will remind you of this in due course.\n\n\nBest regards,\nDieu Donn\u00e9 from the BackCare team",
