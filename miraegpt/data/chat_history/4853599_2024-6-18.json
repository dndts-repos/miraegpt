I've attached two photos, one taken with this iPhone 12 and the other with an iPhone 12 mini, both with the same camera, and it shows the difference.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when opening the password entry menu in some apps, the screen flickers and vibrates strangely. I have a video to explain it better, but I'm not allowed to attach it.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nWhen the seller receives the package, they have 3 business days (5 business days for laptops and household appliances) to repair or replace the product, or 2 business days to make a refund if necessary.\r\nThe customer must meet the following requirements for the return to be processed:\r\n\u2714 Confirms that the device has not been opened by a third party, exposed to water, or suffered an impact or fall\r\n\u2714 Confirms that they have deleted their personal data\r\n\u2714 Has confirmed that they have the return label.\r\n\u2714 Understands that accessories and purchase proof must be included in the return package.\r\n\u2714 Understands that they have 14 days to use the return label.\r\n\r\nRemember: once delivered, the seller has 3 business days (5 business days for laptops and household appliances) to repair or replace the article, and 2 business days to make a refund if necessary.",
