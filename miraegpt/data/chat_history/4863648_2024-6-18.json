            "message": "Hello,\r\n\r\nMy Galaxy S22 5G has a problem:\r\n\r\nThe phone restarts continuously, up to 25 times in a day on occasion. Apps give me an error and freeze during calls, sometimes lasting for 20 minutes during the restart. Before restoring my data last time, I added that I couldn't use the keyboard (it wouldn't open) or set it up from settings.\r\n\r\nI had to format the phone three times since January until today. I prefer a refund because I highly doubt this phone will function well and imagine the reason for its initial refurbishment was that, and I'm very disappointed in the product.\r\n\r\nIt has all necessary updates.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nWhen the seller receives the package, they have 3 business days (5 business days for laptops and household appliances) to repair or replace the product, or 2 business days to make a refund if it's needed.\r\n\r\nThe customer must meet the following requirements for the return to be processed:\r\n\u2714 Confirms that the device has not been opened by a third party, exposed to water, or suffered an impact or fall.\r\n\u2714 Confirms that they have deleted their personal data.\r\n\u2714 Has confirmed that they have the return label.\r\n\u2714 Understands that all accessories and proof of purchase must be included in the return package.\r\n\u2714 Understands that they have 14 days to use the return label.\r\n\r\nRemember: once delivered, the seller has 3 business days (5 business days for laptops and household appliances) to repair or replace the item and 2 business days to make a refund if necessary.",
