Just drop off your package at a nearby return location. A list of locations can be found here: \n\nTo prepare for your return:\n1. Follow the instructions on how to return an item <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://help.backmarket.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014698640-Returns-and-refunds-instructions\">here</a>\n2. Don't forget to include any accessories that came with your product\n3. Remove any existing protective cover or film\n4. Wrap your product and its accessories according to the tips below.\n\nHow to wrap your product:\n\u2022 The box should be strong and sturdy, with your product lying flat inside so it doesn't move during transit.\n\u2022 Attach the return label on top of the box (you can also attach a replacement label inside if the original one is lost or damaged).\n\u2022 Take photos of the package from both inside and outside before sending it. This protects you in case your product gets damaged during transit.\n\nYour return is now ready to be dropped off! We'll let you know when it arrives at our facility.\n\nBest regards,\nBack Market Customer Care, Back Market Customer Care",
