However, as the customer mentioned that \"water leaked into the phone\", and hence leading to problems on the camera, the device is water damaged. According to the BackMarket Quality Charter 3.4.4, the seller contractual warranty doesn\u2019t cover when the item is oxidized. The device is hence out of warranty and we are unable to issue a return/ refund. Please assist the customer and kindly close the case if no further assistance is required.\n\nRegards,\nSY",
