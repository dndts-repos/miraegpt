We'll let you know if the customer prefers a refund or a reshipment.\n\nIf the delivery starts moving again, a refund won\u2019t be issued, and the order will be considered late.\n\nLet us know if you have any questions or concerns \u2014 we\u2019ll keep an eye out for your reply.\n\nThanks for your help,\n\nDaniel, Back Market Customer Care",
