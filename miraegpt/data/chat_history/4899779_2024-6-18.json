As seen from the pictures attached, the device has scratches upon return. \nThe customer has had the device for a certain amount of time, which suggests that he was satisfied with the device condition upon receipt. Now that the device has scratches upon return, the grade is degraded to a FAIR condition.\n\nHence, a 40 euros deduction is reasonable which indicates that the customer receives a partial refund of 574,67 euros. Kindly confirm with the customer if this is agreeable.\nThank you.\n\nRegards,\nKW",
