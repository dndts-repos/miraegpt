If they can't find the package, we asked them to provide the Certificate of Non-receipt and their ID.\n\nPlease send us a Proof of Delivery (POD) with the customer's signature, or a photo of the package being handed to the customer, within 48 hours. \n\nPlease note: a POD without a signature will not be considered relevant.\n\n- If POD is provided, a police report will be required from the customer to process the claim.\n- If no POD is provided within 2 business days: only ID + Certificate of Non-receipt will be required.\n\nIf the package is lost and the customer has provided all the necessary paperwork, they can choose between a refund or a reshipment. In this case, we recommend that you block the device, if possible.\n\nIn case the order is not found, and the customer chooses a replacement, are you able to send one?\n\nIf not, we'll handle the refund.\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you,\nHillary, Back Market Customer Care",
