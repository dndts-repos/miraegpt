Extra 'very good' because it's important to me to have a scratch-free display. Both times I've purchased a device with visible scratches on the display. How can this be that you always sell devices in a much worse condition than described? As seen on the pictures, there is damage on the display, how do you justify calling the condition 'Very good'?!\n\nThank you for your help,",
