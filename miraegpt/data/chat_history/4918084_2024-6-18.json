            "message": "Hello,\n\nMy product iPhone 12 mini has the above problem:\n\nHello, my camera, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth stopped working one after another within a few days. A restart made Wi-Fi (and probably also BT) available again for a short time, but then it went out and stayed that way. An appointment at the Apple Store support revealed that the parts for the support were not reachable and the device likely comes from Japan. He suspects based on his diagnostic that individual components (e.g., Wi-Fi/BT antenna) were not retrofitted with original parts. He couldn't make an offer for repair. The device has always been in a case and cover and hasn't fallen or gotten wet, etc.\n\nThank you very much for your help,",
