Rather than sending a return, would you consider a 40 euros commercial gesture instead? You could save the harmful carbon dioxide emissions generated by logistics carriers in facilitating a return of a device which is perfectly functional and fit to use for many years ahead.\n\nThank you.\nRegards, \nSY",
