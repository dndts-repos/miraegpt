So, somehow, my package was dropped off or set down somewhere, I have no idea, since I wasn't home, as I was already on my way to work. I've asked everyone in my surroundings if they know anything about the package or any clue - of course not.\r\nTo file a complaint with UPS, I need the sender's phone number to complete the corresponding form. Therefore, I'm not only asking for your help in processing my request but also for providing a phone number that I can enter into the form.\r\nI appreciate your help in advance and would like a rapid solution to this problem.\r\nBest regards,\r\nNikita Schachmeier\r\nThank you very much for your help,",
