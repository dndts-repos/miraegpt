However, it still displays 100% in Settings/Battery settings. Therefore, something seems to have been tampered with. As a result, my trust in the manufacturer's sincerity has been lost.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help,",

According to the Quality Charter, EXCELLENT condition requires the device to be free of scratches on the screen. The customer has had the device for a certain amount of time. This suggests that he was satisfied with the device condition upon receipt.\n\nNow that the device has scratches upon return, the grade is degraded to a FAIR condition.\n\nHence, a \u20ac60 deduction will be made once we have completed the diagnosis of the phone and confirm that there are no further issues with it. In the meantime, please do not refund the customer.\n\nThank you.\n\nRegards,\nYR",
