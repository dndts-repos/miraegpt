            "message": "Hello, \nMy iPhone 12 mini has the above problem: \nGood morning, unfortunately I have to report this to you. The device is absolutely junk. Initially, it immediately caught my eye that the rear glass may not be original because it never fell off (despite case, etc.), but after a week, it shattered. But well, one doesn't complain about that anyway. In addition, the microphone quality is terrible. When recording audio or making calls, the mic seems to be destroyed or defective, making it so sensitive that even a simple finger on the back of the phone is enough to make the conversation unintelligible. Lastly, I now commit the greatest impertinence by making the phone completely unusable after 1.5 months. The battery showed me out of nowhere a warning about an unknown component. Since then, the phone has been OVERALL NOT USEFUL AT ALL! Even with constant charging, it runs out after less than a minute. So I even had trouble setting it back up. I demand a new phone or refund. Because it can't be that I get something like this despite excellent condition. Everyone would get annoyed.\nBest regards,\nFinja W.\n\nThank you for your help,",
