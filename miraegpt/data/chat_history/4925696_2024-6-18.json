In our opinion, it has some signs of wear, so it corresponds to a good condition but not very good condition. We have also ordered an iPhone in the past that was in a very good condition. No real signs of wear. Top. So we had hoped for this price as well.\r\nPictures are attached.\r\nBest regards\r\nSchn\u00f6dewind\r\n\r\nThank you for your help,",
