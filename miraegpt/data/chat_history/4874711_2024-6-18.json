I therefore do not expect intensive cleaning.\nI was very satisfied with my last purchase on Backmarket. As the device was in the same quality class, I have a good reference. Unfortunately, there are clear (!) differences in terms of signs of use on the frame when I bought the iPhone.\nFor this reason, I would like to make use of my right of withdrawal & cancel the purchase.\nYours sincerely.\n\nThank you for your help,",
