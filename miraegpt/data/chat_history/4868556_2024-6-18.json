You can find the list of locations here: \r\n\r\nTo prepare your return:\r\n1. Follow the instructions on how to return an item at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://help.backmarket.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014698640-Returns-and-refunds-instructions\">this link</a>.\r\n2. Don't forget to include any accessories that came with your product.\r\n3. Remove any existing protective covering or film.\r\n4. Package your product and its accessories according to the tips below.\r\n\r\nTo package the product:\r\n\u2022 The box should be sturdy and stable, with your product lying flat inside so it can't move during transit.\r\n\u2022 Attach the return label on top of the box (you can also attach a backup label inside the box in case the original one is lost or damaged).\r\n\u2022 Take photos of the package from both inside and out before you send it. This will protect you in case your product gets damaged during transit.\r\n\r\nYour return is now ready to be shipped! We'll let you know as soon as it arrives with us.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nBack Market Customer Care, Back Market Customer Care",
