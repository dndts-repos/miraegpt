It wasn't possible to unlock my phone using Face ID after turning it on. I visited an Apple Store, where they told me this was a problem with the True Depth camera. Now my question is whether you could help me further since I still have warranty on my device and don't necessarily need Face ID.\nBest regards Lucie Butenandt\nThank you for your help,",
