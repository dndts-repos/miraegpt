Only answering an email costs 1-2% battery, which I think is not normal. I've also compared it with other iPhone 12 Minis from friends. This was already communicated via mail with Backmarket employees. I request verification and possibly replacement of the battery or a new device.\n\nBest regards,\nLeonie Drechsel\n\nThank you for your help,",
