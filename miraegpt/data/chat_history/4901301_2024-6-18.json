The phone has been turned off and on, settings updated, and even restored to factory settings. I've also tried a different SIM card, but nothing changed. I do have network access on other phones with the same SIM card, so the problem is with the phone.\r\n\r\nI tested different SIM cards from multiple operators and still had the same issue.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help,\r\n\r\nOnce the package is received, the seller has 3 working days (5 if it's a laptop or household appliance) to replace or repair your product. Alternatively, they have 2 working days to process a refund (if eligible).\r\n\r\nA return is considered complete when the customer has met all of the following conditions:\r\n\u2714 Confirms that the product was not repaired by someone else and has not been damaged due to a fall or exposure to water.\r\n\u2714 Confirms that personal data has been deleted.\r\n\u2714 Has confirmed having the return label.\r\n\u2714 Understands that they must include accessories and proof of purchase in their package.\r\n\u2714 Understands that they have 14 days to use the return label.\r\n\r\nReminder: Once received, the seller has 3 working days (5 if it's a laptop or household appliance) to replace or repair your product.
