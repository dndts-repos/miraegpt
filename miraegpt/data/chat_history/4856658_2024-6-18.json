Today, when I turned on my iPhone, I noticed that the camera focus doesn't work.\n- It concerns photos and videos\n- Also, the focus doesn't work on Instagram etc.\n- Cleaning again with the microfiber cloths included\n- Restarting and software update did not help further.\nI would kindly ask you to repair or send me a new one.\nOrder number: 40458859\nBest regards, Felix Behr\n\nThank you for your help,",
