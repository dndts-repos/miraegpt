Would you accept a commercial gesture of 50 euros to seek a third-party to repair this issue? this commercial gesture could be used to offset the cost. It also avoids the hassle of deleting all personal data just for a battery repair when returning the phone.\n\nA battery is easy to replace and most shops would be able to do it so you can protect the data within your device instead of a return.\n\nThank you\nRegards,\nJH",
